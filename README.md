# CS612_CourseProject_RecommendationSystem
Recommendation System: Implement a recommendation system using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization to suggest items to users.




Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a relatively simple algorithm, and it may not be able to capture the complex relationships between users and items in your dataset.We have tried a more complex algorithm that is neural collaborative filtering.
Below are rmse :
Non negative matrix factorization: RMSE: 1.933431334650169
Neural Collaborative filtering : RMSE: 0.1999
